# meta-nclawzero-base

Yocto layer for building minimal Linux images for edge single-board
computers — the **Raspberry Pi** and **NVIDIA Jetson** families,
plus optional AI-agent runtime recipes layered on top.

All recipes are ARM-universal (`COMPATIBLE_HOST = "(aarch64|arm).*-linux"`).
The maintainer has booted Pi 4 (2 GB + 8 GB) and Jetson Orin Nano
(8 GB Devkit); other family members (Pi 5, Pi 3 64-bit, Pi Zero 2 W,
Jetson Orin NX, AGX Orin, Xavier NX / AGX, legacy Nano, Thor) are
recipe-compatible but untested. See `INSTALL.md` for the full
`MACHINE` value matrix with tested/untested flags.

No pre-built images are distributed from this repository. Everything
is built locally from upstream source and this layer's recipes.

## What's in here

### Base
- `nclawzero-base-image` — headless console image: systemd, SSH,
  networking, shell/dev tools, Python. This is the "just Linux +
  goodies" image. No compositor, no agent, nothing else.
- `nclawzero-desktop-image` — base + the Weston Wayland compositor
  with its built-in VNC backend. Connect from your workstation via
  `vncviewer <device-ip>:5901`.

### Optional AI agent stack (opt-in)
- `nclawzero-agent-image` — base + ZeroClaw (Rust AI agent runtime)
  + NemoClaw (Node.js sandbox framework, provisioned from upstream
  `github.com/NVIDIA/NemoClaw` on first boot).
- `packagegroup-nclawzero-agent` — same dependencies, for inclusion
  in your own image recipes.

## Recipes

| `recipes-nemoclaw/` | NemoClaw (builds from upstream + local patches) |

## Licensing

This layer is Apache-2.0 licensed. Upstream projects retain their
own licenses:

- **ZeroClaw** (`zeroclaw-labs/zeroclaw`) — MIT
- **NemoClaw** (`NVIDIA/NemoClaw`) — Apache-2.0

The `recipes-nemoclaw/` tree contains three local patches authored
by Jason Perlow. Those patches are themselves Apache-2.0 derivative
work against upstream NemoClaw:

- `0001-fix-snapshot-symlink-protection.patch` — security: guard
  `cpSync` and directory walker against symlink traversal.
- `0002-fix-config-file-permissions.patch` — security: enforce
  mode `0600` on credential config files.
- `0003-feat-agent-defs-zeroclaw.patch` — integration: register
  ZeroClaw as an agent runtime alongside Hermes.

No binaries from any vendor are redistributed through this layer.
All fetches happen at build time from public upstream sources.

## Layer dependencies

- `openembedded-core` (poky)
- `meta-openembedded/meta-oe`, `meta-openembedded/meta-python`,
  `meta-openembedded/meta-networking`
- `meta-raspberrypi` (for Pi targets)
- `meta-tegra` (for Jetson targets, **upstream OE4T fork** —
  `github.com/OE4T/meta-tegra`). See `INSTALL.md` for the Jetson
  BSP setup notes, including the GCC14/glibc2.41 bbappend that you
  may need on recent build hosts.

## Getting started

- **`QUICKSTART.md`** — one-page TL;DR: hardware requirements
  (host + target), a six-step build recipe, pointers into the
  upstream Yocto Project documentation. Start here if you've
  never used Yocto before.
- **`INSTALL.md`** — full build-host setup, `bblayers.conf` /
  `local.conf` templates, Jetson GCC14/glibc bbappend guidance.
- **`FLASH.md`** — writing images to SD cards on Raspberry Pi and
  Jetson Orin Nano (`bmaptool`, `dd`, macOS-specific notes).
- **`docker/README.md`** — Docker deliverables: `nclawzero-demo`
  (one-command interactive bench with zterm TUI + live agent) and
  `nclawzero-agent` (headless runtime for compose/k8s). Published
  to `ghcr.io/perlowja`. If you just want to feel the stack
  before committing to hardware, this is the fastest path.

New to Yocto? The [Yocto Project Quick Build](https://docs.yoctoproject.org/brief-yoctoprojectqs/)
is a 20-minute walkthrough that builds `core-image-minimal` for
qemu — everything `meta-nclawzero-base` does is plain Yocto on top
of that foundation.

### Try the stack in 30 seconds (Docker)

Before touching Yocto or flashing hardware, you can kick the tires
on any x86_64 / arm64 machine with Docker installed:

```bash
docker run -it --rm ghcr.io/perlowja/nclawzero-demo
```

That's it — zterm TUI opens, already connected to a live ZeroClaw
agent inside the container. See `docker/README.md` for the
`nclawzero-agent` headless variant.

## Layer compatibility

- Yocto release: **scarthgap** (5.0 LTS).
- Tested build hosts: Debian 12, Ubuntu 24.04.
